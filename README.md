# Lung Cancer Diagnosis Project

# üìå Overview

This project aims to diagnose lung cancer based on various patient informations including clinical and lifestyle features. The dataset is processed, engineered, and used to train multiple machine learning models to optimize diagnostic performance.

# üîπ Data Preprocessing

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Missing Values

Mean Imputation: SMOK_B, HT_B, WT_B, WAIST_B, SBP_B, DBP_B, CHO_B, LDL_B, TG_B, HDL_B, FBS_B, GOT_B, GPT_B, GGT_B, URIC_B, BIL, WBC, CREAT

Zero Imputation: PCAN80-89, FCAN80-89

Conditional Imputation for SMOKA_MOD_B based on SMOK_B level

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Outlier Processing

IQR-based capping for WBC

# üîπ Exploratory Data Analysis

Correlation Analysis between LUNG and other features

Chi-Square Test for categorical variables

# üîπ Feature Engineering

New Variables Derived:

SMOK_INT = SMOK_B * SMOKA_MOD_B (Smoking Intensity)

ALCO_INT = ALCO_AMOUNT_B / ALCO_B (Alcohol Intensity)

BMI = WT_B / (HT_B/100)^2 (Body Mass Index)

FEV1_FVC = FEV1 / FVC (Degree of Airflow Obstruction)

Family History Score:

Selected PCAN80, PCAN89, FCAN80

Trained logistic regression to determine weights

Final Variable Definition: Cancer_History_Score = x*PCAN80 + y*PCAN89 + z*FCAN80
