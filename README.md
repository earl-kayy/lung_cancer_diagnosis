Lung Cancer Prediction Project

üìå Overview

This project aims to predict lung cancer presence based on various clinical and lifestyle features. The dataset is processed, engineered, and used to train multiple machine learning models to optimize predictive performance.

üìä Dataset

3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Selection

Removed Non-Lung Cancer Response Variables: STOMA, COLON, LIVER, PROST, THROI, BREAC, RECTM, CRC, SSTOMA, SCOLON, SLIVER, SPROST, STHROI, SBREAC, SRECTM, SCRC, SLUNG

üîπ Exploratory Data Analysis

Correlation Analysis between LUNG and other features

Chi-Square Test for categorical variables

üîπ Feature Engineering

New Variables Defined:

SMOK_INT = SMOK_B * SMOKA_MOD_B (Smoking Intensity)

ALCO_INT = ALCO_AMOUNT_B / ALCO_B (Alcohol Intensity)

BMI = WT_B / (HT_B/100)^2 (Body Mass Index)

FEV1_FVC = FEV1 / FVC (Airflow Obstruction)

Family History Score:

Selected PCAN80, PCAN89, FCAN80

Trained logistic regression to determine weights

Final Score: Cancer_History_Score = x*PCAN80 + y*PCAN89 + z*FCAN80

üîπ Model Training & Evaluation

Feature Importance: BMI, WBC, AGE_B, FEV1_FVC, ALCO_INT, SMOK_INT, Cancer_History_Score

2Ô∏è‚É£ Logistic Regression

AUC Score: 0.7601

ROC Curve Visualization

3Ô∏è‚É£ Stacking Ensemble Model

Base Models: RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, SVC

Final Estimator: Logistic Regression

AUC Score: 0.8068

4Ô∏è‚É£ Voting Classifier

Soft Voting with Base Models

AUC Score: 0.8088

5Ô∏è‚É£ K-Means Clustering (Experimental Approach)

AUC Score: 0.5929

üìà ROC AUC Visualization

Plotted ROC Curve for Logistic Regression, Stacking Model, and Voting Classifier.

üìù Notes

Family history of thyroid cancer in close relatives has a stronger correlation with a patient's lung cancer status than a family history of lung cancer in distant relatives.

Hypothesis: ALCO_B, EXER_B, WT_B, FVC may also be relevant features for lung cancer prediction.

üöÄ Conclusion

Stacking and Voting Classifiers achieved the best performance with an AUC score of ~0.81.

Feature engineering and preprocessing played a crucial role in performance improvement.

Further optimization and hyperparameter tuning could enhance results.
